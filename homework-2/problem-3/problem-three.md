##What is an instance variable in Ruby?
An instance variable in Ruby start with the '@' symbol and can only be referenced within the class method. They are different from other variables in that the instance variable doesn't exist with a particular scope, they are alive only on that instance of a class.

##The method '.next' for Integers
The 'int.next' method simply returns the integer that is equal to (int + 1)
```
3.next #This will return 4 because (3 + 1) = 4
(-4).next #This will return -3
```
